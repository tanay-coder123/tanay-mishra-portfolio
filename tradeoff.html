        <h2>Project Overview</h2>
        <p>
            The Engineering Trade-Off Simulator is a Python-based tool inspired by
            FIRST Robotics Competition (FRC) design decisions. It evaluates multiple
            mechanical design options using weighted performance metrics such as
            speed, torque, and cost.
        </p>

        <h2>Problem Motivation</h2>
        <p>
            In robotics and engineering design, improving one variable often comes
            at the expense of another. This project was created to model those
            trade-offs programmatically and to practice object-oriented programming
            while applying real engineering constraints.

        <h2>How It Works</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>User inputs ratings for speed, torque, and cost (1–10 scale)</li>
            <li>Each design is represented as a <code>Design</code> object</li>
            <li>Weighted scoring evaluates overall performance</li>
            <li>Constraints (minimum torque) affect evaluation outcomes</li>
            <li>Designs are ranked and analyzed comparatively</li>
        </ul>
    </section>

            <li>Object-Oriented Programming (classes, methods, attributes)</li>
            <li>User input validation</li>
            <li>Algorithmic scoring & ranking</li>

        <h2>Future Improvements</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Customizable weighting profiles for different design goals</li>
            <li>Graphical output of trade-off comparisons</li>
